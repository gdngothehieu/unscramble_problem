Run time analysis (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) 

Task 0:
2 Get item in a list + print 7 items from a list
O(9)

Task 1:
Nexted for loops (quadritic rate) (twice called) + set an item in set() + get len of set()
O(2n^2 + 2n)

Task 2:
Nested for loop + get function in a dictionary + get item in a dictionary
O(n^2 + 2n)

Task 3:
Part A:
While loop + sort in set() + 2 x in s in set() + len in a list + 2 get items in a list + 2 simple line
O(n + n log n + 2n + 5)

Part B:
2 x in s in set + interaction in set
O(3n)

Task 4:
For loop + sort in set() + 2 get item in list + 2 set item in set + for loop  + 2 x in s in set + set item in set
O(n log n + 7n + 2)
